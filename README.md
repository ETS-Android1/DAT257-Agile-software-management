<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2 id="overview"> OverView</h2>
The goal of this project was to create an application, where a user can rate movies and series that he/she has watched. They can rate it based on various parameters and also add notes. This way the user gets the ability to keep track on what movies they have watched and also what they thought about them.<br><br>

The application was created by the group Eurythmics during the course DAT257 and has the following members:<br>
Omar Suliman : @omar-su <br>
Jenny Carlsson: @cajenny / @jennycarlsson <br>
Desirée Staaf: @Staafd <br>
Eugene Dvoryankov: @EugeneDvoryankov <br>
Ida Nordlund: @idanordlund <br>
Oscar Palmkvist: @DwarfMamba2 <br>
Fabian Flaa: @Foxboi <br>

<!-- Gitinfo -->

The github project contains of three folders and some gradle files. <br><br>

App: Contains the source folder of the application. More about the code will be described in the "stucture" section. The app folder also includes a folder for the JUnit tests.<br><br>

Documents: Contains all of the documents for thw project. This includes:<br>
 <ul>
  <li>Business model canvas</li>
  <li>Project scope- first mockup</li>
  <li>Project scope description</li>
  <li>Folder containing our team relfections</li>
  <li>Folder containing individual reflections for each team member</li>
</ul> 

<!-- Figma -->
<h2 id="figma"> Figma</h2>
To create the mockup for our the application we used the software Figma. Here we tried out different design solutions, which we showed the stakeholder to decide the direction we wanted to go. We also created certain components in Figma which we exported into our android studio project.

<!-- Trello -->
<h2 id="trello"> Trello</h2>
Trello was used as a planning tool for our project. We have used two different trello boards, one for project planning and one as our scrum board. <br><br>

Here is the link to the Trello workspace: LINK

<!-- Setup -->
<h2 id="getting-started"> How to run the Application? </h2>
If you don't have an android phone you will need to download an android virtual machine to run the app on. This is easy to do in Android Studio.

<ol>
  <li>Download <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> och follow the  instructions.</li>
  <li>Clone this repo in Android Studio using "get from version control" alternativ. Then just copy paste the link of the repo.</li>
  <li>Make sure that you already have a Virtual device in AVD manager. If not download a "Pixel 3a API 30" which should work just fine.</li>
  <li>Build the project and run the MainActivity.</li>
</ol>
